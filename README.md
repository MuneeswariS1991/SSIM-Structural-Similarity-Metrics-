# SSIM (Structural-Similarity-Metrics)
The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a full reference metric ; in other words, the measurement or prediction of image quality is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference. Due to its popularity, SSIM is often compared to other metrics, including more simple metrics such as MSE and PSNR, and other perceptual image and video quality metrics. SSIM has been repeatedly shown to significantly outperform MSE and its derivates in accuracy, including research by its own authors and others. SSIM estimates the perceived quality of images and videos. It measures the similarity between two images: the original and the recovered. There is an advanced version of SSIM called Multi Scale Structural Similarity.
